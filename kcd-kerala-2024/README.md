## Abstract

"Prometheus-Operator‚Äù is a well adopted solution for streamlining and automating Prometheus based monitoring stack within Kubernetes clusters.

A significant moment arrived in early 2023, breaking a four-year wait with the introduction of the much awaited ScrapeConfig CRD. This addition marks a significant leap forward in capabilities, shaping the future trajectory of Prometheus-Operator for years to come.

The ScrapeConfig CRD exemplifies Prometheus's reach beyond Kubernetes, illustrating how the operator empowers users to manage non-Kubernetes targets seamlessly. This showcases Prometheus's versatility and robustness in diverse operational environments.

In this talk, Jayapriya, a Prometheus Operator member and key contributor from the RedHat Monitoring team, will provide an in-depth exploration of the new ScrapeConfig CRD.
